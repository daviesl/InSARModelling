Hi Zena,

 

First, happy new year and congrats on the placement in the Cloud Enablement team! I’m sure you’ll have many fulfilling opportunities come from it in the year ahead.

 

I just want to touch base on the possibility of a talk to cover the work you did for rotation 2 (and close it off), would you have a timeslot available in late January to give a short presentation? We can be flexible on the date.

 

Cheers,

Hi Laurence,

Thanks for this email, I hope your new role has been enjoyable and refreshing.

In short,

1)      Yes

2)      Yes

3)      No, but almost yes J

[The long version]

I’m happy to say that I’ve narrowed down why my OpenCL kernel is returning NANs.

I think it may be due to the OpenCL inbuilt functions such as: “Sqrt(), Exp(), Sin(), Cos() etc.” but I need a little more time to confirm this.

These functions take a generic type. If “cl_khr_fp64” is enabled within your code then you can use doubles, however I just have a hunch that this may be were the issue lies.

 

I’ve cancelled out other possibilities like the OpenCL buffers not reading/writing correctly.

I’ve even copied the code from my OpenCL kernel (.cl file) and put it directly within a for loop in Rayleigh.h and all the unit tests passed! However, when that same code is compiled and run as an OpenCL kernel it returns –NANs.

[The long version]

 

Anyway, I think it’s a great idea to do a presentation like that.

I’m going to continue working on getting my code working this week and then I will begin preparing a presentation next week (no matter what).

I’ll keep you updated.

Thanks!

 

Zena

HI Zena,

 

No problem, we’re all busy in new roles!

 

I haven’t had a chance to look at your commit, so just briefly to get started can we clarify the following:

 

1)      Does your code compile?

2)      Does it run without crashing?

3)      Does it pass the unit test?

 

If you have (1) and (2) we can work towards (3).

 

In the meantime, to finish off the rotation work Karol and Alexei have suggested that it would be great if you could do a 30 minute informal discussion of your findings with some slides on what you set out to do and the results (or code) so far. If you happen to have it passing the unit test then a table of performance times would be great and would rate highly on your PDP criteria, but don’t stress if you’re not there. We can make do with what you have.

 

I will be in Perth from this evening for the rest of the week so once you have the documentation to a level you’re happy to hand on we can arrange a meeting to discuss. Any questions or concerns, just let me know J

 

Hope all is going well for you in rotation 3! 

 

Cheers,

Hi Laurence,

My apologies on missing this email. I didn’t see it before I left Friday evening.


I remember you mentioning yesterday, when we met in the carpark, that you wanted to reschedule for later in the week?

Is there another day that would suit better or would this afternoon still be better?

 

I’ve also commited my changes to the repo. The documentation will be next (sorry for the delay on this).

Hi Laurence,

Firstly, my apologies this email is reaching you later than you were expecting – I just landed the final blow to our ICT Grad Project with UC, portfolios, wikis, presentations, videos all submitted!

 

Anyway, following on from our conversation at the RD morning tea this morning I was just wondering what time would be best next week to meet to review my PDP from rotation 2.

 

Thanks and I hope you have a fantastic weekend! (probably mostly indoors – thank you rain…)

Thank you Angie,

 

It was a pleasure to do the slide and help promote MSB work, thank you again for making the suggestion! I’m happy to hear it went well after catching up with Anthony yesterday. Apparently Neil presented the work on passive seismic since he’s using the code right now, which is good to see they are applying it in new areas.

Hi Angela,

 

I’ve put together a quick slide. Sorry for the delay! Preview and notes below:

 

NOTES:

This slide shows a single station HVSR inversion at GSQ Eulo 1 (Adventure Way). 

The scale ambiguity is accounted for by adopting an average top shear velocity of 290 m/s using the MASW acquired via active seismic at the near surface. (This is one way to do it – there are many others)

Hi Laurence,

 

Great to chat! 

 

The current draft of the presentation is saved here - D2017-185392. The audience is Groundwater Branch staff and two NT DENR staff in a casual workshop where they plan to target their groundwater drilling from their AEM data. 

 

Thanks for taking the time to add in a slide with some basic talking points on HVSR so Anthony can make them all aware of the advancements in the work you are doing on HVSR processing, the potential uses/ impacts for them and any limitations they should be aware about.  He will reference you on the slide. It is good if we can give your work some promotion J Just pop the slide in somewhere in the section called Part 3: New method development. 

 

Just for your info/interest, the workshop is on Jan 3rd and this is the proposed agenda:

9:30-10:10      Review aims/objectives of EFTF project (Laura)

10:10-10:40     Discuss DENR projects/activities in the Southern Stuart Corridor area (Des)

10:40-11:00     Overview of other EFTF activities/projects in the Southern Stuart Corridor area (Anthony)

11:00-11:20     Morning tea break

11:20-12:30     Explore AEM and identify targets (Alice Springs and Ti-Tree)

12:30-1:30      Lunch break

1:30-3:00       Explore AEM and identify targets (Western Davenport and Tennant Creek)

3:00-3:20       Afternoon tea break

3:20-4:30       Wrap up/additional discussions

 

Cheers,

Looking good!

 

Just flicking through the first 100 or so it’s clear some didn’t converge, but there are quite a few good results in there too. Computing the chi-square goodness of fit of the synthetic forward models vs the data would be a good place to start. You’re on point with gradients – that could be useful as a simple informative measure, but I can see some well-fitted models have inverted layers and some interesting features which wouldn’t be well characterised by a simple gradient. 

 

I would be keen to try to use known properties of sediments to attempt to attenuate the scale ambiguity. Just using sand and sandstone (and anything else you think might be in there), searching for the right Vs/Vp and density combination would be the easiest bet. 

 

I’m happy to help you write code to do this.

 

Cheers,

I suppose the next step is to go through and actually understand what is going on here? Maybe find where the models seemed to have converged and estimate the Vs/Depth gradient and plot them on a map against other data points???

Thank you for your assistance Andrey, I’ve successfully loaded 2014b, problem solved and you can close this ticket.

 

I was mistakenly searching for configure_matlab.sh

 

Might be worth adding the paths to the OPUS docs?

Hi,

>find /apps/matlab/ -name config_matlab.sh

shows:

/apps/matlab/R2014b/bin/config_matlab.sh
/apps/matlab/R2015a/bin/config_matlab.sh

/apps/matlab/common/bin/config_matlab.sh

/apps/matlab/R2015b/bin/config_matlab.sh

/apps/matlab/R2014a/bin/config_matlab.sh

so it should be available to you after you loab a matlab module.

Hi Andrey,

 

Thank you for your reply.

 

1)      The license is comes with four components: email, username, password and license number. This conforms to the LNU specification.

2)      Where is config_matlab.sh located? It is not in the path after loading the matlab module, nor is it located in /apps/matlab/*

Hi,

OK. Lets look at our OPUS web site then. You are trying to run matlab interactively, so look at the "License requirements" section 2. 

1) Did you contact your IT support to verify that the license you have is an LNU license? (or if you are trying to use your own license, did you login to your MathWorks account via your browser and changed it to be LNU?).

2) Did you run config_matlab.sh the first time you use each version of MATLAB?

Hi Andrey,

 

Thank you for your reply. In answer to your queries:

 

1)      One of the members of my team already has matlab working interactively on NCI. His name is Thomas Fuhrmann. Therefore I’ve been asked to do the same in his absence but it appears that the authentication scheme is not as per your OPUS website.

2)      I am trying to run something that both needs access to g/data and also needs more RAM than my local machine. NCI is my only option right now.

3)      I have tried authenticating matlab on the VDI and the same error occurs.

 

Can you please help debug this issue?

Hi,

I suspect that the authentication doesn't work as our compute nodes do not have access to internet.

We do not have matlab_ga user group. Creation of such a group would require your IT support allowing access to GA license server from raijin nodes. There may be also license restrictions. You will need to consult with Mathworks and GA IT support. We normally recommend using matlab on local computers, not on raijin. It doesn't run well in parallel. You may also try using matlab on VDI.

Best wishes,

Andrey

I am trying to use Matlab on Raijin in an interactive session express queue job. I have authentication details for matlab for my team, and according to https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/MATLAB I need to be added to the matlab_ga (Geoscience Australia) user group. How would I do this?

 

Just booting matlab and using the auth details provided to my team does not work. It has the following error:

I’m finding that the password may not be working. I will follow up with NCI to see if this is a user group issue.

I would agree that it can get stuck in local minima. The MCMC algorithm employed self-tunes so it should “in theory” be able to sample the full posterior. It would require more test runs to confirm, but again I am loathe to do so on my PC because it is so very slow to plot. If it is possible to use Matlab on the NCI I would try that option.

Thanks Laurence,

 

I see what you mean about the GBIS output. For some reason its ‘best’ model is not similar to the InSAR data at all (in contrast to your code which is in the right ball park imho). As you suggest, GBIS might not be sampling the full space, or is getting fooled by a local minima – do you agree?

Using just the two data sets and removing the DEM offset, here are the differences so far using just the MOGI model on ascending and descending.

 

These are not the figures you saw earlier. It turns out I had run the inversion before the xmas shutdown. However, you can see that the residual plot exhibits the same large values.

 

You can see larger (non-standardised) residuals in the Python version. This is likely due to the low weights applied by Varres to the data points in these areas. I am not yet convinced that the quadtree sampling applies these same weights. This testing would take a few days I expect due to the run time.

 

PyMC3 + Varres

GBIS using Quadtree







 

For interest, the joint+marginal plot of dV and depth is more correlated:

Hi Payroll,

 

I have a backlog of timesheets which I need to fill out in Aurion. Unfortunately the relevant managers are not available to approve submitted timesheets such that I can enter new timesheets.

 

Would it be possible to submit a list of times to your team and bulk submit my timesheets?

Running headlong from the fire

 

 

Tearing pages from my diary

Ripping moments from my heart

I was blinded and tormented

It was failing from the start

 

I felt the fire in your will consume me

And I fought to break away

 

I longed for relief thinking it was release

 

But like two opposing rods of iron strongly magnetised

We missed out on living life

Hey mate, happy new year.

Yep it's very verbose.

How far did you get through the inversions before you ran out of storage? If it isn't very far, I can make some changes to make the output less verbose for you.

Most useless files are the following:

best_model.
best_model.forward.*
output.pmap

You can probably discard all forwardmodels.*.bin and models.*.txt except the very last one (largest number). You may want to create a copy of one directory and use sort -n to test that your script is robust enough.

Hey matee, 

Happy 2018. I expect that this is an issue you  know something about. Will it just be a case of mass deleting files from the inversions. If so what should my strategy be? Which files are most useless?

Hi Angela,

 

I’ve put together a quick slide. Sorry for the delay! Preview and notes below:

 

NOTES:

This slide shows a single station HVSR inversion at GSQ Eulo 1 (Adventure Way). 

The scale ambiguity is accounted for by adopting an average top shear velocity of 290 m/s using the MASW acquired via active seismic at the near surface. (This is one way to do it – there are many others)

Hi Laurence,

 

Great to chat! 

 

The current draft of the presentation is saved here - D2017-185392. The audience is Groundwater Branch staff and two NT DENR staff in a casual workshop where they plan to target their groundwater drilling from their AEM data. 

 

Thanks for taking the time to add in a slide with some basic talking points on HVSR so Anthony can make them all aware of the advancements in the work you are doing on HVSR processing, the potential uses/ impacts for them and any limitations they should be aware about.  He will reference you on the slide. It is good if we can give your work some promotion J Just pop the slide in somewhere in the section called Part 3: New method development. 

 

Just for your info/interest, the workshop is on Jan 3rd and this is the proposed agenda:

9:30-10:10      Review aims/objectives of EFTF project (Laura)

10:10-10:40     Discuss DENR projects/activities in the Southern Stuart Corridor area (Des)

10:40-11:00     Overview of other EFTF activities/projects in the Southern Stuart Corridor area (Anthony)

11:00-11:20     Morning tea break

11:20-12:30     Explore AEM and identify targets (Alice Springs and Ti-Tree)

12:30-1:30      Lunch break

1:30-3:00       Explore AEM and identify targets (Western Davenport and Tennant Creek)

3:00-3:20       Afternoon tea break

3:20-4:30       Wrap up/additional discussions

 

Cheers,

 

Angie

In that case could you perhaps add a constant offset of +-180  in that case to ensure none of your values fall in that range?

A moving average, but it would matter for any kind of filter.  I am filtering an aircraft bearing that when flying close to north fluctuates between values in range 0-10 and 350 to 360 so you don’t want to average 1’s with 359’s.

Hi Ross,

 

What kind of filter are you applying?  A moving average?

 

I’m trying to understand the problem here: Can you just use modf(angle,360)? Are you solving for it in an inversion and it needs to be differentiable?

Do you know an elegant solution to filtering data like angles or bearings that might go from say 0-360 or say -180-180 such that values you don’t get the situation of averaging say

1 2 1 3 1 0 359 1 360 3

In that case could you perhaps add a constant offset of +-180  in that case to ensure none of your values fall in that range?

A moving average, but it would matter for any kind of filter.  I am filtering an aircraft bearing that when flying close to north fluctuates between values in range 0-10 and 350 to 360 so you don’t want to average 1’s with 359’s.

 

The matlab unwrap() function is one option I have found

Hi Ross,

 

What kind of filter are you applying?  A moving average?

 

I’m trying to understand the problem here: Can you just use modf(angle,360)? Are you solving for it in an inversion and it needs to be differentiable?

Hi Rakib,

 

The tuning branch contains the latest way to downsample from linear to log spacing by using the Konno Ohmachi smoothing operator as the interpolation operator. I’d advise that we pursue this avenue with more testing. It is not production-ready and therefore a how-to would be premature.

Hi Laurence,

 

Hope you're doing well. I was just wondering if it's possible to merge the tuning branch to develop and also whether the updates in the tuning branch produce significantly different results. 

Alexei has requested me to write a short how-to on installing and running the code and I was wondering if the updates in the tuning branch should be included in this internal 'release', or whether they could wait to be incorporated at a later date.

I reckon max amplitude only. I wouldn’t put weight into standard deviation. ;)

 

Also you may get away with it.  Lowering chains to 300 and sticking to 28 cores will get you there. Most will take between 10 and 20 cpu hours I reckon, and given you have 800 sites that’ll be 10KSU right there.

Make it 300 chains for 6 nlayers.

 

For 300 chains, I recommend dropping your cores down to a single node of 28 cpus on Broadwell. This will minimise dead time between iterations and maximise your KSU efficiency. Keep RAM usage the same (I think Broadwell is predominantly 128GB per node anyway).

 

Set your depth tuning min to 1. I know this is hugely unlikely, but it won’t hurt to keep that prior wide.

Got it.

 

Half look like they converge well enough.

 

Here’s a thought:

 

Gaussian prior on top velocity, mu=200, std dev = 100

Gaussian prior on basement velocity, mu=sandstone, std dev = reasonable

 

Fit all model ground profiles to this assumption and then plot residuals (i.e. models that deviate in top and basement by more than 3 sigma) spatially and look for patterns.

Sounds fair, even though a gradient to basement relationship would be nice, it would only make sense if the top Vs at each site is the same.

Hi mate,

 

Here are the relationships between the approximate mean of the Vs/ depth gradient and the depth to basement.

 



 

 

As you can see it looks as though there is not much to go on here. I am a little concerned that to get information from these inversions will require lots of massaging and care which I cannot do for so many sites.

 

The inversion are here in case you’re interested.

So I only have enough hours to invert a subset of them. What would be a good method for trying to find what hv curves are most likely to yield a good result. Could I look at the amplitude and the standard deviation?

Make it 300 chains for 6 nlayers.

 

For 300 chains, I recommend dropping your cores down to a single node of 28 cpus on Broadwell. This will minimise dead time between iterations and maximise your KSU efficiency. Keep RAM usage the same (I think Broadwell is predominantly 128GB per node anyway).

 

Set your depth tuning min to 1. I know this is hugely unlikely, but it won’t hurt to keep that prior wide.

Got it.

 

Half look like they converge well enough.

 

Here’s a thought:

 

Gaussian prior on top velocity, mu=200, std dev = 100

Gaussian prior on basement velocity, mu=sandstone, std dev = reasonable

 

Fit all model ground profiles to this assumption and then plot residuals (i.e. models that deviate in top and basement by more than 3 sigma) spatially and look for patterns.

Sounds good.

 

When you say approach, do you mean the post-inversion fit of top and basement? I would say it’s a good place to start.

 

Regarding your config files:I noticed in S8000 gradient was clipping.

 

For all sites perhaps use wide priors. Gradient: 1 to 200

 

If you are limiting to 5 layers, you can drop the # of chains down to 250 or 300 (worst case uniform posterior on layers gives 50 chains per nlayers bin which is enough in my experience).

 

Some more complex curves need more layers, I see you’ve gone up to 7 on site S21061. What are you going to set as your max nlayers? (I like 7, looks like you get nice results).

Hi mate,

 

Here are the relationships between the approximate mean of the Vs/ depth gradient and the depth to basement.

 



 

 

As you can see it looks as though there is not much to go on here. I am a little concerned that to get information from these inversions will require lots of massaging and care which I cannot do for so many sites.

 

The inversion are here in case you’re interested.

 

Cheers

Initial pass of SMC. T025D and T131A data look ok. I think I might chop out T130A since the varres output (bottom middle) looks a bit off.

I like your eye for detail. Round 2. This time round depth is relative to ground topography, not MSL. Also, I might’ve over-stated the radius – here radius is ~44m.

Also, the depth and volume in your plot are negatively correlated, whereas I’d expect a positive correlation. E.g. if the volume (size) increases then the depth must increase to obtain the same surface deformation.

 

Could depend on your depth definition of course!

The 2017 MAP cavity radius comes out at ~55m vs the 2016 blast which Wei estimated at 25m.

 

Note that the depth sensitivity seems to be fairly poor. I’m looking into this right now.

Hi James,

 

I’ve recently blown the lid on how the method is used. Single station observations can’t be used for cover thickness without additional priors on scale. Happy to discuss with you when convenient, there are some revelations that will require rethinking on use of passive seismic for pre-drilling geophysics.

Hi Laurence

Attached is the error file for the inversion, for the slide 23. 

This is the file output for the inversion for slide 13 AdventureWay_inverted_result.pvs

For near offsets slide 23, AdventureWaynear_inverted_result.pvs

 

Depth is approximated as half maximum wavelength, the spread length is maximum wavelength, so 5 m spaced 48 channels, 235 m max wavelength, max depth 235/2, but usually less as minimum freq recorded is 4 Hz, 400 m/s vel, 4 Hz is 100 m wavelength, max depth 50 m.

 

Uncertainties change with noisy data and irregular points to be modelled. Noisy means lots of refractor or airwave, other mode, data mixed in with Raleigh wave. That is where love wave data is good.

 

Also where I have bedrock - sediment interface changing laterally within geophone spread, the curve is real but looks odd so ends up with a bigger error which I ignore, I had this problem in Antarctica. I had geophones half on deep sediments then half on very shallow sediments.

Looks great, page 13 pf your slides is what I’m interested in. Shear velocity plus standard deviation vs depth. Would you have a csv of gridded shear velocity to depth with uncertainty or ERMS?

 

If I can easily demonstrate that this MASW plus one HVSR sounding can be used to recover the 300m interface, we can use this as a starting point for efficient active source surveys atop AusArray sites.

 

Looks like you have 30m of resolution which is great. May I pick your brain on a few points?

 

1)      What would be the minimum array size to achieve between 5m-10m depth?

2)      How does the array size scale with depth?

3)      How do uncertainties/ERMS change with array size?

Hi Laurence

Hi Josef,

 

Would you recall doing an MASW on Adventure Way in the Southern Thomson project? If so would you have your name on a report somewhere for me to find it?

Hi Laurence

Attached is the error file for the inversion, for the slide 23. 

This is the file output for the inversion for slide 13 AdventureWay_inverted_result.pvs

For near offsets slide 23, AdventureWaynear_inverted_result.pvs

 

Depth is approximated as half maximum wavelength, the spread length is maximum wavelength, so 5 m spaced 48 channels, 235 m max wavelength, max depth 235/2, but usually less as minimum freq recorded is 4 Hz, 400 m/s vel, 4 Hz is 100 m wavelength, max depth 50 m.

 

Uncertainties change with noisy data and irregular points to be modelled. Noisy means lots of refractor or airwave, other mode, data mixed in with Raleigh wave. That is where love wave data is good.

 

Also where I have bedrock - sediment interface changing laterally within geophone spread, the curve is real but looks odd so ends up with a bigger error which I ignore, I had this problem in Antarctica. I had geophones half on deep sediments then half on very shallow sediments.

Looks great, page 13 pf your slides is what I’m interested in. Shear velocity plus standard deviation vs depth. Would you have a csv of gridded shear velocity to depth with uncertainty or ERMS?

 

If I can easily demonstrate that this MASW plus one HVSR sounding can be used to recover the 300m interface, we can use this as a starting point for efficient active source surveys atop AusArray sites.

 

Looks like you have 30m of resolution which is great. May I pick your brain on a few points?

 

1)      What would be the minimum array size to achieve between 5m-10m depth?

2)      How does the array size scale with depth?

3)      How do uncertainties/ERMS change with array size?

Hi Karol,

Yes, we can defer. Just figured I’d give everyone an early heads-up.

Active source would be fine. Pooling ideas on the most logistically effective technique/combination is the point of the exercise! I expect we’d need to follow up with a simple field experiment – one week of TC120 data in combination with some active source data.

Hi Marina,

 

Late Jan will be when I’m returning, right?

 

I’m going to leverage my new work to propose a level increase as per the role description (read top line duties) that was advertised in the attached. I feel that right now is the time to act because otherwise I fear I will miss my opportunity given how active this area of research is, and that the precedent now is there is no penalty for stealing research. There are parties interested in my intellectual property outside of the mineral systems branch.

Good afternoon Marina,

 

This is just a short note to mention the time I spent with Michael Asten this morning from 10am to 1pm was highly informative for the passive seismic survey design and processing considerations that we’ll need to address in the coming months.

 

I’m happy to add this time to the running total for passive seismic related tasks during my secondment if that suits you.

 

Cheers,

Hi John,

Hi Lennie

               As we start to move forward of the project the Vsat systems (QUO-02067-B6G6 ) were ordered for, I have been asked to do some of the stock take of the different materials required.

 

With regards to the quote  QUO-02067-B6G6 and the shipping document, we note that the order was broken into two shipments.

I can only account for 4 systems that came in on the Toll Gen connote 2866005298.  

 

Could you please check on the second shipment and send us the details.

 

Thanks

 

John

Subject:	Varres update [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

Morning Matt,

 

Here's where I'm up to with the varres / modelling: I'm still in the depths of the covariance estimation in varres trying to nail down how it is obtained. The main problem is the assumption that data is on a cartesian grid (which is never the case). First step for a randomly sampled set of point pairs (lines) a ramp function 

 

a(dx^2) + b(dy^2) + 2abdxdy 

 

is minimised and subsequently used to "adjust" the change in los displacement. There are no comments on what theory is used here. The next step is the model function for atmospheric covariance is then fit to these adjusted los displacement differences over each line. I'm going to give it a few more minutes before considering reverting back to the incorrect cartesian grid assumption and just stating in the model that it will incur a non-negligible bias on the error function.

 

Cheers,

I can’t recall what DC spike means in this context. Is it a value you’re changing?

 

Clipping is for the start and end of the line, yes.

Maybe try this. Sorry, with NCI being down I have no test bed and I’m going from manual-described behaviour of the function. It may take some back and forth to get this to work.

Is it something we can do over email? Otherwise I can come up now for 15 minutes – I have a meeting at 2pm but after 3pm my calendar should be relatively open. NCI is still down so that has kind of written off my day. Good timing J

Maybe try this. Sorry, with NCI being down I have no test bed and I’m going from manual-described behaviour of the function. It may take some back and forth to get this to work.

It looks from visual that the code I last sent you won’t work.

 

Maybe try this. Sorry, with NCI being down I have no test bed and I’m going from manual-described behaviour of the function. It may take some back and forth to get this to work.

It looks from visual that the code I last sent you won’t work.

 

Maybe try this. Sorry, with NCI being down I have no test bed and I’m going from manual-described behaviour of the function. It may take some back and forth to get this to work.

Possibly a numpy versioning issue.

 

Try running in a new session the below:

 

import pkg_resources

pkg_resources.get_distribution("numpy").version

 

What is the output?

Is it something we can do over email? Otherwise I can come up now for 15 minutes – I have a meeting at 2pm but after 3pm my calendar should be relatively open. NCI is still down so that has kind of written off my day. Good timing J

Is it something we can do over email? Otherwise I can come up now for 15 minutes – I have a meeting at 2pm but after 3pm my calendar should be relatively open. NCI is still down so that has kind of written off my day. Good timing J

It looks from visual that the code I last sent you won’t work.

 

Maybe try this. Sorry, with NCI being down I have no test bed and I’m going from manual-described behaviour of the function. It may take some back and forth to get this to work.

Cool, looks like you’re using an old version of numpy. Pad is implemented in 1.7+

 

Not sure if this will work (copypasta from a forum) but try adding this function near the top of filter.py:

 

def pad_array(input_array):

    '''

    Pads an array with one zero row and one zero column (added to the ends of the array)

    '''

    size = a.size

    shape = a.shape

    new_shape = (a.shape[0]+1, a.shape[1]+1)

    new_size = (new_shape[0])*(new_shape[1])

 

    zero_array = np.zeros(new_size).reshape(new_shape)

    zero_array[:a.shape[0], :a.shape[1]] = a

 

    return zero_array

Good afternoon Marina,

 

This is just a short note to mention the time I spent with Michael Asten this morning from 10am to 1pm was highly informative for the passive seismic survey design and processing considerations that we’ll need to address in the coming months.

 

I’m happy to add this time to the running total for passive seismic related tasks during my secondment if that suits you.

 

Cheers,

	Hi Michael 

	 

	Good to chat yesterday. I look forward to seeing you at the Minerals Forum on Tuesday.

	 

	As discussed we will not be going into the shallow passive in any great detail at the forum so a more focused discussion with Alexei and Laurance would be best on the Monday about approach, current activities and the codes. Are you AG and LD available to meet Michael?

	 

	Nicole I think after 3 pm on Monday is best for a follow up about future collaboration ( can you see if Marina and Karol are also available please)

	 

	Cheers

		I will in in Canberra on mon-tues 11-12 dec next week, to attend the UNCOVER overview on Tuesday.  I would like to talk with you about possible synergies between the Monash ongoing microtremor passive seismic work, and the GA program.  I would also like to get an update on software developments at GA for passive seismic methods if this is possible sometime on the Monday. I will also aim to make some contacts at ANU on the Monday but will try to work around availability of your self and colleagues.
		
		Attached for possible interest is a paper I am giving at AESC next February - a light-hearted look at passive seismic looking for Pleistocene megafaunal bones - but the principal is quite serious in demonstrating the value of combining HVSR with 2-station SPAC analysis, with minimal logistical overheads

Hey Laurence,

 

Do you have a minute today to talk on the phone about the inpefa code? Just coming up with an error when running it - I’m sorry you’ve probably told me already but I’ve probably forgotten.

 

Thanks

Hi Richard,

 

Thank you for sending this through to me, I am still very keen to show off the new developments made in GA in this sphere. Just for future reference may I ask that you also CC my direct supervisor Matt Garthwaite for all matters where my time will be redirected to EFTF activities until the conclusion of the secondment?

 

Also, it was great to discuss my rating revision with you the other Friday and hear your decision to revise it back to Superior for the full period. When you have a chance it would be good to sit with you when you have time to go through some of the criteria you touched on.

Hi Michael 

 

Good to chat yesterday. I look forward to seeing you at the Minerals Forum on Tuesday.

 

As discussed we will not be going into the shallow passive in any great detail at the forum so a more focused discussion with Alexei and Laurance would be best on the Monday about approach, current activities and the codes. Are you AG and LD available to meet Michael?

 

Nicole I think after 3 pm on Monday is best for a follow up about future collaboration ( can you see if Marina and Karol are also available please)

 

Cheers

Hi all,

 

I will be available on Dec 11-12. Michael, it would be a pleasure to demonstrate our progress in automated H/V inversion and to discuss with you novel techniques to combine with other observation types e.g. SPAC. I’m happy to work around Alexei’s availability.

Thank you,

 

Usage through 2018 may grow. This is because of the diversity of products we’ll be generating, as well as testing new codes. I have been working on making existing codes more efficient, but this is lower priority than product generation.

Laurence,

 

I can ask for the extra 50kSU for you as CI, I shouldn’t need to ask Karol or Marina unless you think it necessary. I’ll check with Alexei (but what is TTT?)

 

Do you expect your usage to be stable through all of 2018 or might it grow?

I can fix up short iquota and usage. Would it be possible to source another 50KSU for compute for vy72? Please confirm with Karol Czarnota or Marina Costelloe if needed.

 

Also, regarding next quarter, estimated usage will be 100% of what we’ve used this quarter plus whatever Alexei needs for his TTT products. I don’t expect that to be much at this stage.

Great, looking forward to it.

I've had a think about obtaining a Gaussian distribution for the gradient. Basically requires having to come up with a transform for phi to obtain a distribution such that the ratio (1+phi)/(1-phi) is a Gaussian distribution. Picking phi~N() won't work because E(phi)=0 and thus E(1+phi) is not zero thus the ratio distribution can't be Cauchy, let alone Gaussian.  

I'm out Wednesday lunch, and an afternoon would be better. Say tues or thurs afternoon. How does that suit you?

Hi Matt,





Sounds good. Once I'm back in the swing of things on Monday we can catch up perhaps in the afternoon re Varres progress? Then on Friday hopefully you'll see some PyMC3+Mogi output using the Varres downsampling. Does that sound ok?

Hi Laurence,

 

So in the coming week I’d like you to focus on:

 

·         the variable resampling of interferograms (building in the varres code) and

·         first pyMC3 implementation with the Mogi model.

I’ll be out of office Tues-Thurs inclusive (do you intend to go to the AGm and Christmas party?)

 

Let’s catch up on your progress on Monday and Friday.

 

Cheers,

HI Laurence

 

I have just been told that I have the power!

Ok I have been advised to make a decision on this, and I would like you to still have the opportunity to attend the AEGC conference in Sydney in February.

You do not need to present.

You will be invited to help out at the booth (as all staff members who will be attending will be required to do).

 

Do you accept this invitation (btw I WILL be there)

 

PS Are you Laurence Stuart on Facebook?

?Hi Marina,

 

Unfortunately my talk was rejected because it was miscategorised as energy (at their end) and was never followed up. As far as I know, I am not allowed to attend AEGC 2018.

 

Cheers,

HI Zena,

 

No problem, we’re all busy in new roles!

 

I haven’t had a chance to look at your commit, so just briefly to get started can we clarify the following:

 

1)      Does your code compile?

2)      Does it run without crashing?

3)      Does it pass the unit test?

 

If you have (1) and (2) we can work towards (3).

 

In the meantime, to finish off the rotation work Karol and Alexei have suggested that it would be great if you could do a 30 minute informal discussion of your findings with some slides on what you set out to do and the results (or code) so far. If you happen to have it passing the unit test then a table of performance times would be great and would rate highly on your PDP criteria, but don’t stress if you’re not there. We can make do with what you have.

 

I will be in Perth from this evening for the rest of the week so once you have the documentation to a level you’re happy to hand on we can arrange a meeting to discuss. Any questions or concerns, just let me know J

 

Hope all is going well for you in rotation 3!

Hi Laurence,

My apologies on missing this email. I didn’t see it before I left Friday evening.


I remember you mentioning yesterday, when we met in the carpark, that you wanted to reschedule for later in the week?

Is there another day that would suit better or would this afternoon still be better?

 

I’ve also commited my changes to the repo. The documentation will be next (sorry for the delay on this).

Hi Laurence,

Firstly, my apologies this email is reaching you later than you were expecting – I just landed the final blow to our ICT Grad Project with UC, portfolios, wikis, presentations, videos all submitted!

 

Anyway, following on from our conversation at the RD morning tea this morning I was just wondering what time would be best next week to meet to review my PDP from rotation 2.

 

Thanks and I hope you have a fantastic weekend! (probably mostly indoors – thank you rain…)

Hi Tim,

 

As you probably know, Karol provided participants for the upcoming AIG workshop with instructions on how to set up VirtualBox on their laptops…but I have a couple of questions for him – I wonder if you can answer them? (he dobbed you in after all! ??) 

 

These were my questions:

 

I already have a VM on my computer called Virtual PC but I take it I still need VirtualBox to run the AIG workshop programs on, correct?

If so, do you think it might cause a problem having 2 VM’s installed? Or is VirtualPC capable of “doing the same thing” as VBox anyway?

P-wave refraction would definitely be a good check on the interfaces revealed by H/V. The MASW (or SASW) is necessary to fix the scale ambiguity of H/V so the more independent observation types, the better!

Sounds like fun, we only need Marina to approve. While we are at it, extracting P-wave refraction or direct arrival velocities would also be useful, as that Italian fellow did at the conference.

Thanks, got the ppt J

 

So there’s a project where lines of 20-minute passive have been acquired, and it would be great to get some sort of MASW on the passive data to constrain the H/V. Think this is something you could be interested in?

I found my SEG conference summary PowerPoint, and related documents. I think it was the APNS2015_Xia.docx talk and maybe he said it verbally that is was 3/4 depth love to Raleigh.

NK_VE_cm.tif

VE with mean coherence mask < 0.15

NK_VE_nomask.tif

VE with no mask

The mean coherence of ascending and descending. Equivalent to

Sqrt((0.5*corA)^2 + (0.5*cord)^2)

This definition may not be what we’re after – it yields a very conservative coherence map.

	Hi Marina,

	 

	That’s no problem at all.

	 

	Alexei has agreed verbally to include the latest S0400 inversion using my transD code. It will be “doctored” to match the drilling profile by shifting the top layer Vs prior until the interface MLE is on target. I will follow up tomorrow to confirm whether this is still on track.

	 

	The parameterisation I have developed eliminates the scaling ambiguity (non-uniqueness) from the inversion so that it converges much more quickly and satisfies the adaptive MV Gaussian PC proposal scheme because it reduces multimodality in the PPD. I expect that this scheme is worth a lot to GA for the deliverable target in April and ongoing for the cover thickness toolbox. The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss the future development and implementation.

	 

	On a side note, I briefly had a catch-up with Richard Blewett on Friday in the café. Using his words, in his mind he felt that my performance in the three months from July to September (noting he made this assessment mid-September) were not of the standard he had observed in the leading six months.  I will be following up with  a request for his assessment criteria. He hinted that his decision was in consultation with my immediate superiors at the time.

Subject:	H/V of S0400 [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

Hi H/V enthusiasts,

 

I’ve come up with a novel parameterisation that reduces the work the inversion has to do to get a good fit. It also exposes the velocity-depth scale ambiguity (a.k.a terrifying non-uniqueness) completely.



In the above plot, note the Vs0 (bottom left) histogram. This is the top layer Vs. I set a uniform prior from 20 to 100, and the posterior is indeed uniform from 20 to 100. This is because I removed the scale ambiguity governing depth and velocity (see my previous email on the subject) with a parameter projection. The width of the top Vs prior is propagated in the Vs depth profile on the right – the wider this prior, the wider the “uncertainty” that is propagated to each interface depth. Also note that if you scale everything (velocities and depths) you will still fit the data, hence the interface depth you can see at 50m is cosmetic. I can make it whatever I want by scaling velocities and depths (but not density).

 

Now for the good news. Next to the Vs0 histogram is the Vs/Depth gradient histogram. Notice how this is not uniform at all, and has a maximum likelihood. The gradient is unique and data-driven.

 

I would like to arrange a time to give a short presentation of my findings to whoever is interested and propose a way of working with the data such that realistic uncertainties can be obtained from HVSR in combination with other priors.

 

Cheers,

Hi Marina,

 

That’s no problem at all.

 

Alexei has agreed verbally to include the latest S0400 inversion using my transD code. It will be “doctored” to match the drilling profile by shifting the top layer Vs prior until the interface MLE is on target. I will follow up tomorrow to confirm whether this is still on track.

 

The parameterisation I have developed eliminates the scaling ambiguity (non-uniqueness) from the inversion so that it converges much more quickly and satisfies the adaptive MV Gaussian PC proposal scheme because it reduces multimodality in the PPD. I expect that this scheme is worth a lot to GA for the deliverable target in April and ongoing for the cover thickness toolbox. The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss the future development and implementation.

 

On a side note, I briefly had a catch-up with Richard Blewett on Friday in the café. Using his words, in his mind he felt that my performance in the three months from July to September (noting he made this assessment mid-September) were not of the standard he had observed in the leading six months.  I will be following up with  a request for his assessment criteria. He hinted that his decision was in consultation with my immediate superiors at the time.

Hi Sarah,

 

Attached are the two geotiffs for VE and VU. The coherence threshold was fixed at >0.1 and the input 7.5m cell size was downsampled by a factor of 4 to 28m. The interpolation method was linear using a triangulation method. Unfortunately (as we discussed earlier) the Python RBF methods run out of memory on such dense input data. If it is worth spending a few days developing a cython RBF using a reduced radius of influence we could investigate that at a later date.

 

The ipython notebook used to produce this is based on the one Matt created here:

	Hi Richard,

	 

	I’ve just had a quick conversation with HR after they informed me that my Superior rating for EOFY 2017 was revised to a Fully Effective rating inclusive of the three months to September 2017 regarding the pay point progression.

	 

	Their recommendation was that I approach you about it, would you be available for a short chat at your earliest convenience, perhaps over a coffee?

	Hi Laurence

	 

	Sorry about the delay in responding to your enquiry below.

	 

	The performance rating  provided to HR for you at the end of the 2016/17 performance cycle (30 June 2017) was ‘Superior’.  When your supervisor provide a rating at the end of the deferral period (30 September 2017) the rating given was ‘fully effective’, which was supported by the Chief of Division.

	 

	I suggest you have a chat with your supervisor regarding the change to the rating.

Hey Laurence,

 

I think the attached file has a long provenance and is now being passed to you J (courtesy of Bex).

In outlook, select the very small ‘folders’ icon in the far bottom left hand corner of your screen (see attached image). It will open up a whole list of folders that you can have access to. I right clicked on the folders that I wanted to view regularly and opted to save them to my favourites folder. Outlook now shows me when there are new messages in those folders. I suggest you look for some house sitting in the For Sale… folder (and maybe some of the others too)

I’ve just had a quick conversation with HR after they informed me that my Superior rating for EOFY 2017 was revised to a Fully Effective rating inclusive of the three months to September 2017 regarding the pay point progression.

Mate,

 

I’ve got a data-driven problem and wondering if you’re interested.

 

Basically, I have a parameterisation for H/V inversion which takes the gradient of velocity to depth as a tuning parameter.

 

The rule f=Vs/(4H) applies to average velocity of sediments above the major interface but not the avg velocity of the layers below the major interface.

 

Reckon we can come up with a data-driven rule for quickly determining the full curve velocity gradient based on key features (f, relative magnitude of H/V at f, etc)?

I know what you prefer, but you know as well as I do that the paper race was a real thing and CSIRO are working on this as we deliberate. There is a hurry.

 

Now, I can allow users to specify a beta but this isn’t exactly fool-proof. A data-driven method would be publishable.

 

By the way, I’m delivering. See:

I would prefer that you sleep during night rather than thinking. Seriously.

Please focus on your current duties because it is very important for you to deliver good results to your current supervisor, trust me.

Thanks Alexei,

 

Looks like the f=Vs/4H rule J

 

I had a think about the beta scaling factor to match E(phi) =approx= 0 last night. It would be great to use that rule but it only applies to the sediments above the main interface.

 

Can you think of another data-driven rule that provides a heuristic to basement velocities?

 

Correct determination of beta leads to much faster convergence. 15 minutes versus 2+ hours on 112 cores for the uniform Vs prior.

Hi Alexei,

 

Quick question, from your slides for the workshop would you have available that nice downward sloping curve for the velocity to depth relationship for Stavely?

 

I have a tuning factor beta for for phi=(beta*Vs-d)/(beta*Vs+d) which works well enough but want to see if it could be determined from your graph, and hopefully the data or physical relationship that produced your graph. 

 

Cheers,

Thanks Alexei,

 

Looks like the f=Vs/4H rule J

 

I had a think about the beta scaling factor to match E(phi) =approx= 0 last night. It would be great to use that rule but it only applies to the sediments above the main interface.

 

Can you think of another data-driven rule that provides a heuristic to basement velocities?

 

Correct determination of beta leads to much faster convergence. 15 minutes versus 2+ hours on 112 cores for the uniform Vs prior.

Mate,

 

I’ve implemented the velocity-depth index method and found a combination that seems to work. Just running a couple more trials but progress is good. Inversion time for 11017 is about an hour until “convergence” is reached. The output looks like a mess because as we expected the depth-velocity ambiguity is ever-present. Happily we now know we have to account for that anyway.

You rock up at ANU boat shed (on Sullivan’s creek) before 6pm on a Tuesday. Don’t be late (and traffic through the city is hectic), ideally be a little early, hence leaving GA at 1720 is not quite ridiculous.

 

So yeah, we borrow kayaks from ANU mountaineering club. They are usually relaxed about membership at this time of year.

Hi Richard,

 

I’ve just had a quick conversation with HR after they informed me that my Superior rating for EOFY 2017 was revised to a Fully Effective rating inclusive of the three months to September 2017 regarding the pay point progression.

 

Their recommendation was that I approach you about it, would you be available for a short chat at your earliest convenience, perhaps over a coffee?

 

Kind regards,

Hi Laurence,

Firstly, my apologies this email is reaching you later than you were expecting – I just landed the final blow to our ICT Grad Project with UC, portfolios, wikis, presentations, videos all submitted!

 

Anyway, following on from our conversation at the RD morning tea this morning I was just wondering what time would be best next week to meet to review my PDP from rotation 2.

 

Thanks and I hope you have a fantastic weekend! (probably mostly indoors – thank you rain…)

Hi Alexei,

 

I’ve just had a quick conversation with HR, apparently my Superior rating for EOFY 2017 was revised to a Fully Effective rating inclusive of the three months to September 2017 regarding the pay point progression. It was the first that I had heard of it, and HR advised that I begin a conversation with you first of all to discuss how this rating was downgraded. Would you like to meet for a cup of tea and discuss informally if there is anything that we may have omitted in discussions leading to this? I must admit that it was a surprise.

Hi Laurence

 

Sorry about the delay in responding to your enquiry below.

 

The performance rating  provided to HR for you at the end of the 2016/17 performance cycle (30 June 2017) was ‘Superior’.  When your supervisor provide a rating at the end of the deferral period (30 September 2017) the rating given was ‘fully effective’, which was supported by the Chief of Division.

 

I suggest you have a chat with your supervisor regarding the change to the rating.

 

Cheers

?Thanks Maree,

 

This is good to know. Regarding the rating, I was told by HR not so long ago that it was 'superior'. Not that this would change the progression, just curious.

A sensible prior with an insensible fixed first layer?

 

Also, remember this is transdimensional. It could be a tiny tiny layer and it is really zoomed in. This problem presents itself when there is a sharp high frequency increase such as in your 11017 data.

 

Just recently I had some examples where one inversion looked like a zoomed in version of another. Let me dig it up for you.

You’re right, but the disadvantage of fixing the first layer Vs is that if you set it too large you might be asking for a model that falls outside the priors for Vs and depth. For example, in reality you might have unconsolidated rubble directly on sandstone or limestone. Setting Vs large may ask the sandstone layer to be enormous (or too deep).

 

Using an index and a global parameter for the top Vs should help alleviate this problem. The depth prior could still be an issue but that is in fact also solvable by using a Dirichlet prior and floating the maximum depth. I won’t do that unless it is actually a problem.

Fixing the first layer’s velocity as you originally presented should at least mean that assuming that such a ratio is able to be found with the inversion algorithm, it should converge to a unique solution with said ratios. It would then just be a matter of finding alpha using other information (or indeed just searching for a depth). Not sure if that sort of thing is scientifically acceptable, you are far more numerical than I probably know.

I’ll keep the depth parameter, so there’s still four parameters per layer which should incur no loss of information (I think). The reason to use an index like this is to remove the competing ambiguity that both depth and Vs depend upon. Brilliant idea you had there. I’m afraid you might have to be a co-author if it works out.

Agreed, excellent chat/

 

You share my exact sentiments on the parameterisation. I do believe that the ratio could come in handy, but haven’t figured out a good way to exploit it yet. I’ll have a think tonight. It’s primary purpose (like any parameter transformation) would be to reframe the priors and to make the parameterisation more orthogonal to improve principal component proposals, although this should already be accounted for in the pc-proposal class I wrote a month back.

 

Regardless, by taking the scaling factor as an ambiguity we do know that taking the inversion at face value is not the best answer, but with “good” priors it gets close as we’ve seen sometimes.

 

By writing the above, I’m starting to think that by adding principal component proposals but keeping the priors in the space of the original parameters I’ve somewhat crippled the inversion because the priors don’t frame the search space well enough to compensate for PC proposals and it can land on the moon more often. This is something I can easily test now by disabling PC proposals with that handy switch in the config file.

Hi mate,

 

Good chat today, I like getting deep into the science like that… very stimulating. I had a think and I tend to agree that you need to invert for both d and Vs despite the model m=being insensitive to the actual raw values. The reason I figured for this is that the model also needs to know the ratio between layers for d and vs (eg. d1/d2 and vs1/vs2). These ratios are certainly sensitive to the actual values even if the whole profile can be changed with a single scaling factor with no effect on the response.

I’ll keep the depth parameter, so there’s still four parameters per layer which should incur no loss of information (I think). The reason to use an index like this is to remove the competing ambiguity that both depth and Vs depend upon. Brilliant idea you had there. I’m afraid you might have to be a co-author if it works out.

By inverting for this index would you not still lose information about V1/V2 and d1/d2 etc?

Symmo,

 

How about this. I’m about to try taking a leaf from the bible of remote sensing:

 

Phi = (Vs – d) / (Vs + d)

 

Prior is always -1 to 1.

Agreed, excellent chat/

 

You share my exact sentiments on the parameterisation. I do believe that the ratio could come in handy, but haven’t figured out a good way to exploit it yet. I’ll have a think tonight. It’s primary purpose (like any parameter transformation) would be to reframe the priors and to make the parameterisation more orthogonal to improve principal component proposals, although this should already be accounted for in the pc-proposal class I wrote a month back.

 

Regardless, by taking the scaling factor as an ambiguity we do know that taking the inversion at face value is not the best answer, but with “good” priors it gets close as we’ve seen sometimes.

 

By writing the above, I’m starting to think that by adding principal component proposals but keeping the priors in the space of the original parameters I’ve somewhat crippled the inversion because the priors don’t frame the search space well enough to compensate for PC proposals and it can land on the moon more often. This is something I can easily test now by disabling PC proposals with that handy switch in the config file.

 

Cheers,

Hi mate,

 

Good chat today, I like getting deep into the science like that… very stimulating. I had a think and I tend to agree that you need to invert for both d and Vs despite the model m=being insensitive to the actual raw values. The reason I figured for this is that the model also needs to know the ratio between layers for d and vs (eg. d1/d2 and vs1/vs2). These ratios are certainly sensitive to the actual values even if the whole profile can be changed with a single scaling factor with no effect on the response.

 

Cheers

Hi Alexei,

 

I’ve just had a quick conversation with HR, apparently my Superior rating for EOFY 2017 was revised to a Fully Effective rating inclusive of the three months to September 2017 regarding the pay point progression. It was the first that I had heard of it, and HR advised that I begin a conversation with you first of all to discuss how this rating was downgraded. Would you like to meet for a cup of tea and discuss informally if there is anything that we may have omitted in discussions leading to this? I must admit that it was a surprise.

Hi Laurence

 

Sorry about the delay in responding to your enquiry below.

 

The performance rating  provided to HR for you at the end of the 2016/17 performance cycle (30 June 2017) was ‘Superior’.  When your supervisor provide a rating at the end of the deferral period (30 September 2017) the rating given was ‘fully effective’, which was supported by the Chief of Division.

 

I suggest you have a chat with your supervisor regarding the change to the rating.

Hi Laurence

 

Sorry about the delay in responding to your enquiry below.

 

The performance rating  provided to HR for you at the end of the 2016/17 performance cycle (30 June 2017) was ‘Superior’.  When your supervisor provide a rating at the end of the deferral period (30 September 2017) the rating given was ‘fully effective’, which was supported by the Chief of Division.

 

I suggest you have a chat with your supervisor regarding the change to the rating.

 

Cheers

Hi Alexei,

 

I’ve just had a quick conversation with HR, apparently my Superior rating for EOFY 2017 was revised to a Fully Effective rating inclusive of the three months to September 2017 regarding the pay point progression. It was the first that I had heard of it, and HR advised that I begin a conversation with you first of all to discuss how this rating was downgraded. Would you like to meet for a cup of tea and discuss informally if there is anything that we may have omitted in discussions leading to this? I must admit that it was a surprise.

I found my SEG conference summary PowerPoint, and related documents. I think it was the APNS2015_Xia.docx talk and maybe he said it verbally that is was 3/4 depth love to Raleigh.

See gaTranfer/Laurence

Agreed, excellent chat/

 

You share my exact sentiments on the parameterisation. I do believe that the ratio could come in handy, but haven’t figured out a good way to exploit it yet. I’ll have a think tonight. It’s primary purpose (like any parameter transformation) would be to reframe the priors and to make the parameterisation more orthogonal to improve principal component proposals, although this should already be accounted for in the pc-proposal class I wrote a month back.

 

Regardless, by taking the scaling factor as an ambiguity we do know that taking the inversion at face value is not the best answer, but with “good” priors it gets close as we’ve seen sometimes.

 

By writing the above, I’m starting to think that by adding principal component proposals but keeping the priors in the space of the original parameters I’ve somewhat crippled the inversion because the priors don’t frame the search space well enough to compensate for PC proposals and it can land on the moon more often. This is something I can easily test now by disabling PC proposals with that handy switch in the config file.

 

Cheers,

Hi mate,

 

Good chat today, I like getting deep into the science like that… very stimulating. I had a think and I tend to agree that you need to invert for both d and Vs despite the model m=being insensitive to the actual raw values. The reason I figured for this is that the model also needs to know the ratio between layers for d and vs (eg. d1/d2 and vs1/vs2). These ratios are certainly sensitive to the actual values even if the whole profile can be changed with a single scaling factor with no effect on the response.

 

Cheers

Hi Neil,

 

Just letting you know I haven’t dropped the mic on this one, I gave it some thought last night and will develop the parameterisation this weekend. It takes one parameter out of the model, namely the initial shear velocity, and this will require some coding changes to allow a fixed parameter in the model (not as easy as you’d think given how it was written). This results in two parameters for the first layer and four parameters for each subsequent layer.

 

I’m keen to develop with you an example of solving for the alpha scale ambiguity based on rock properties as a  prior. This would be a subsequent step to the inversion and would also need a bunch of rock property data (that Stanford U table being a starting point). For shallow application in groundwater, would you know of a suitable reference for collected and measured sediment seismic (shear, compression velocities and density) properties?

Hi mate,

 

Good chat today, I like getting deep into the science like that… very stimulating. I had a think and I tend to agree that you need to invert for both d and Vs despite the model m=being insensitive to the actual raw values. The reason I figured for this is that the model also needs to know the ratio between layers for d and vs (eg. d1/d2 and vs1/vs2). These ratios are certainly sensitive to the actual values even if the whole profile can be changed with a single scaling factor with no effect on the response.

 

Cheers

Marina,

 

It was the email at the bottom of this chain. This morning I proactively called Alexei and obtained those details verbally. It was exactly these supporting role requirements that I’m trying to get a handle on. I know that this isn’t something that you have an answer to but I was hoping a conversation between members of the passive seismic team could be started.

 

I am sorry. This is a frustrating experience and it is consuming a lot of time and worry, and the meeting yesterday to clarify my role has left me wondering what my role will be.

I do appreciate the L&D opportunity to meet and interact with stakeholders and to learn the other inversion strategies. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have to emphasise that I am keen to attend the L&D workshop in Perth.

 

My concerns lie squarely with the organisation of the dry run and following that how I would be contributing to the running of the workshop in Perth. How am I able to contribute when none of the other members of the passive seismic team (Karol, Alexei, etc) have personally communicated with me or made any attempt to communicate with me on what my contribution will be? I had to call Alexei today and ask him specifically what I will be doing, and his answer was the email that I forwarded to you.

Hi Laurence

 

I think there is a lot of benefit to you, which is why I am keen for you to attend.

 

It is an opportunity to participate, listen to how other inversion techniques are taught (what questions do the audience have), meet stakeholders and interact with stakeholders so you can better understand the audience for the work GA does which in turn helps you align strategically to the science direction we are taking as an agency.

There is a chance you will meet someone who can be of help to you in some technical or geological way.

You might get to learn some of the challenges of working in industry (both financial geological and resourcing).

You will be building your professional network, professional resilience and building a reputation for you as well as GA (you represent GA at these functions).

 

The event may not have direct bearing on what you work on ‘today’ but as a holistic view of your career, progression, exposure it is a terrific opportunity.

You will hopefully encourage dialog (even if it’s in the breaks), you will hopefully get a fresh perspective from the audience, you might develop new ideas, you will get to improve some of your skills and talk about your work – including your trans-d work – informally.

You will add to the event – by being there it gives you the opportunity to contribute – because I know you are an awesome professional.

 

I hope that makes sense..

 

Not going would not be a problem but please let me know if you specifically do not want to attend today.

I’m still unsure as to what my role is for the workshop.

 

Without any mention of the trans-d work I was heavily involved in, I can’t add anything. Why am I there?

Hi Marina,

 

I just had a quick chat with Alexei on his proposed structure for the passive seismic workshop dry run tomorrow, and this is his schedule:

 

30 minutes

Lecture

2.5 hours

Using Geopsy

 

His initial request was for me to go through the manual. I sadly don’t have time to go through a manual, or if I do it is just to read it (I’ve skimmed it), not to make corrections. Subsequent tasks for me are ideas, notes and suggestions on how to improve the workshop.

 

I am concerned about it. The manual reads like a tutorial in a way, but it could do with a lot of work and refinement, and I don’t have the time in my current role to do this.

Just the tile thickness is needed, and perhaps an estimate of the thickness of the cement/sand if the contrast isn’t great.

 

Where is the data?

You going to have split phase from the tile. Not sure if u can model it very easily. It's old problem for pavement quality assessment.

Agreed, excellent chat/

 

You share my exact sentiments on the parameterisation. I do believe that the ratio could come in handy, but haven’t figured out a good way to exploit it yet. I’ll have a think tonight. It’s primary purpose (like any parameter transformation) would be to reframe the priors and to make the parameterisation more orthogonal to improve principal component proposals, although this should already be accounted for in the pc-proposal class I wrote a month back.

 

Regardless, by taking the scaling factor as an ambiguity we do know that taking the inversion at face value is not the best answer, but with “good” priors it gets close as we’ve seen sometimes.

 

By writing the above, I’m starting to think that by adding principal component proposals but keeping the priors in the space of the original parameters I’ve somewhat crippled the inversion because the priors don’t frame the search space well enough to compensate for PC proposals and it can land on the moon more often. This is something I can easily test now by disabling PC proposals with that handy switch in the config file.

Hi mate,

 

Good chat today, I like getting deep into the science like that… very stimulating. I had a think and I tend to agree that you need to invert for both d and Vs despite the model m=being insensitive to the actual raw values. The reason I figured for this is that the model also needs to know the ratio between layers for d and vs (eg. d1/d2 and vs1/vs2). These ratios are certainly sensitive to the actual values even if the whole profile can be changed with a single scaling factor with no effect on the response.

 

Cheers

Hi Jonathan,

 

It was good to discuss your H8 project today. For your interest and possible usage, here is some of the code I wrote for wildfire tracking. 

 

https://github.com/daviesl/BEnKFIRe

 

I think that to obtain the derived csv files I had to parse some of the H8 data from GA’s Sentinel Hotspot system, and for the remaining band data I had to use GDAL to window the data to the necessary level. It is probably not what you’re looking for re Australia-wide data parsing, but if you are after a test area the WA Waroona 2016 fire is sufficiently large to monitor test conditions using a variety of hotspot sources.

 

I will try to find the band data I used – it will be big so I can put it on /short/public/ for you when you need it.

 

Best,

Actually, you are in a unique position (pls pardon the pun) to exploit this non-uniqueness, and the estimation process would as such need to take into account its character.

 

Remembering that the depth distributions are relative to let’s say a scaling factor ? whereby all Vs and depth posteriors are scaled by ?, you have to make an assumption about some consistent property of each of your HVSR soundings. Since they’re all meant to be mapping the paleo-valley itself, would it be worth using the expected properties of the paleo-valley itself? Say you’re looking for porous sandstone. This has a particular density, and a particular Vp/Vs. These values are available for you to find. The Vs of this layer will be scaled by an unknown ?. Perhaps by assuming a distribution of Vs, Vs/Vp and density for the paleovalley layer you can extract the full posterior of the paleovalley top and bottom. It will end up being a depth distribution at each sounding with a wider variance than the partition counts, and this makes sense because the partition counts does tend to have sharp peaks.

Non-uniqueness in a geophysical solution is no surprise to me. I don’t really have any intention on mapping the base of the palaeovalley with HVSR but rather using the depth distributions (most likely something like the partition counts) in conjunction with other datasets to inform some stochastic estimation process.

Hi Neil,

 

Just an FYI, and before you get started on passive seismic today, there is something I only discovered last night: an embarrassing level of non-uniqueness regarding the scale of Vs and depth. This is the reason for the TopVs config property which should be fixed to something reasonable like 100. Ideally the inversion would have a Gaussian prior on Vs that increases with depth at roughly the average rate for the continent, but this does end up making the proposals trickier, so some balance needs to be had regarding the prior for Vs. I gave it a very wide prior last night and got a strange result so the inversion will indeed go there.

Hi Neil,

 

I’ve created a new version which I’m waiting to test but fairly sure works.

 

The rationale is the addition of a new config property: TopVs. It will require you to guestimate the top layer Vs for every inversion, but this is semantic because there is a way to scale the entire posterior solution later to your needs, say post inversion you now know something else about the ground structure, you can match it up. This will hopefully alleviate the strange inverted layer we were seeing earlier which is indicative of starting conditions.

 

The new version is in /short/public/lsd547/rjsmc

 

Again, top secret stuff.

Alexei,

 

They yield absolutely exactly the same response.

 

All this time I’ve let all parameters float free (with the exception of at one time fixing basement). Sometimes the inversion “lands in the wrong spot” meaning that this ratio is too high to fit within the priors and it tries to compensate with inverted layers.

 

The solution is to fix the surface Vs. There is no way around this, and by fixing the surface Vs (or at least giving it a very narrow prior) this is probably how you have found a solution to almost every inversion you’ve ever done.

 

Attached is the code for plotting so that you can see for yourself.

Look at the ratio of Vs between each model in corresponding layers. Same with depth. Vp is derived from Vs.

HI Laurence

 

I’m glad you let me know

It adds colour to the situation you have been in. I won’t raise it – you are probably right… 

 

WE will keep an eye out for something new for you… 

I’m not sure I understand the whole story for hvsr… but I am getting there

Your email also suggests to me that although timing is bad the trip to Perth is in line with possible future work (here at GA)

 

No worries – any time – take care

Hi Marina,

 

Would you think that chatting to Karol would change anything? I am unsure. I feel that it is mainly for your own information.

 

At this stage I feel that if an opportunity arises elsewhere in modelling I would be inclined to take it. It is my current mode of thinking that my involvement in transdimensional inversion of hvsr was for advertising purposes. Of course, as you had advised earlier, I probably shouldn’t send this email, but I have to divorce myself from the body of work for a while to fulfil my current role duties and I think honesty about the situation is the most efficient way to do so.

 

I should give you some airspace from this problem, my apologies for aggravating J

 

Best,

Hi Laurence

 

Sorry about the delay in responding to your enquiry below.

 

The performance rating  provided to HR for you at the end of the 2016/17 performance cycle (30 June 2017) was ‘Superior’.  When your supervisor provide a rating at the end of the deferral period (30 September 2017) the rating given was ‘fully effective’, which was supported by the Chief of Division.

 

I suggest you have a chat with your supervisor regarding the change to the rating.

 

Cheers

I’m forwarding on to you a request from EGD as to whether we would be able to give a 5 minute update on AusArray for their team brief this Friday at 2pm. Would you think that is feasible?

 

I’m not sure what time the workshop dry run is on but if this doesn’t conflict it could be good to let them know. I would be happy to present a couple of slides on your behalf if you’re not available.

Hi Spiro,

 

For your interest and from our conversation, these interactive demos allow you to test samplers on a variety of toy distributions: http://chifeng.scripts.mit.edu/stuff/mcmc-demo/

 

Sequential Monte Carlo is a relatively new method that was born from particle filters and is surprisingly similar to the neighbourhood algo: http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/doucet_defreitas_gordon_smcbookintro.pdf

 

There is a lot of recent work in this area. Happy to talk more when you’re free.

Essentially TFA method creates densities to extract the median – not just simply averaging the results.

It’s the reason why they parted from detriggering….

They use Welch’s method for PSD estimation for each component. It sounds more appropriate than just stacking FFTs.

I thought it was interesting that they did state the period of observation for sampling at those depths was five days.

One other thing, in your case perhaps the subsample bias should be ignored. Data error matters.

 

In the BatchHtoV script in the Tuning branch just set the resample_bias to a vector of ones. It should change the focus of the inversion to higher frequencies which matter more for your purposes and will be less prescriptive about lower frequencies which may be biased due to the sensor limitations.

Hmm. Looks like it hasn’t converged.

 

Try changing the data offset max to 0.68 or thereabouts. I find it can over-compensate and it takes longer to converge sometimes.

 

Also another thing to try is increasing the number of chains to 800 since you have max 8 layers. Either that or drop your max layers to something ruthlessly lower like 5.

 

Sorry it’s a pain to work with sometimes. That’s the nature of “automated” Bayesian inversions. Everything works when your limits are infinity, below that very little is guaranteed.

Hi Jonathan,

 

It was good to discuss your H8 project today. For your interest and possible usage, here is some of the code I wrote for wildfire tracking. 

 

https://github.com/daviesl/BEnKFIRe

 

I think that to obtain the derived csv files I had to parse some of the H8 data from GA’s Sentinel Hotspot system, and for the remaining band data I had to use GDAL to window the data to the necessary level. It is probably not what you’re looking for re Australia-wide data parsing, but if you are after a test area the WA Waroona 2016 fire is sufficiently large to monitor test conditions using a variety of hotspot sources.

 

I will try to find the band data I used – it will be big so I can put it on /short/public/ for you when you need it.

 

Best,

Hi Nick,

 

Matt has asked me to keep you informed of my movements re my previous team and account for all time spent on it. I just spent the last two hours doing handovers for passive seismic:

 

1)      1hr for Neil Symington in Groundwater to use the inversion code on ~800 sites

2)      1hr meeting with Marina discussing returning movements and updating her on Neil’s usage of the code.

 

I’ll keep a spreadsheet of the hours and note them in comments in my timesheet. This week I have one more 1hr meeting tomorrow (at 4:30) for discussion on my involvement in the workshop and 3hrs on Friday for the dry run. I will see about how much of that I actually need to attend.

 

I will also try to keep you informed more in advance - apologies for the retrospective notice for today.

 

Would you like updates on the InSAR work I am covering too this week? I can formulate a weekly update for the two weeks Matt will be away in retrospect on Friday.

 

Regards,

?Hi Marina,

 

No reminder appointment has been sent to the division about RD morining tea which means that the originally schedulled date has slipped the attention of both Jade and myself. This may have happened due to some other rescheduled items such as the new format team brief and that the last morning tea was postponed by a week on request from OSE.

 

Since the rest of RD won't be aware of the morning tea, would you be ok to reschedule? I'm not sure how much you've prepped the section already, so if you are keen to go ahead today we can try to make do.

 

Apologies for the confusion!

Subject:	RE: Local approximation for SMC [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

Good morning again Marina,

 

As a follow up, I should highlight that local approximation techniques will enable inversion codes to run on desktop workstations rather than multi-node supercomputers because of the ten-fold speedup. An example of existing use is the Neighbourhood Algorithm which uses a more crude nearest-neighbour approximation rather than fitting a quadratic to the local cluster.

Subject: Local approximation for SMC [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

 

Hi Marina and Alexei,

 

Here is a paper that would be a good reference implementation for local approximation for inversions in the codebase Ross and I have developed:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1694.pdf

 

It would require some refactoring of the parallelisation of forward model processing to separate the returned products from the model proposals via some sort of approximation conduit class. This approximation class can then be used to produce the approximate forward models and likelihood weights, and it should also inform the inversion engine where forward models should be computed given a cloud of proposed particles at each kernel iteration.

 

The upshot of this is that much more intelligent proposals can be used e.g. dual-averaging NUTS.

 

I strongly recommend that this becomes a priority in the next few months such that the H/V deliverable is met in a timely manner. Without this smoothing, the compute time on RJSMC for each H/V observation could be quite large given the minimum cloud size should be proportionally greater than approximately k*n^2 where n = number of parameters.

 

Please feel free to ask questions, I would also be happy to run a short mathematical seminar on the proposed direction of Transdimensional H/V processing for internal GA staff.

 

Thank you and regards,

Yes, but the fit should work too. Remember the bottom of the curve? The upper bound should prevent it from underfitting the zero at the right base of the main peak.

0.5 is just below what the inversion yields, but I suspect that it’s estimate of ~0.6 is too much.

 

Wasn’t S0912 down-shifted by 0.6?

 

In any case, the Stavely must have some interesting underground mountains.

First I read papers, then look at the data. Taking into account that shift is along all frequencies implies that it is something structure related.

Probably station sits not on flat surfaces but all structure is inclined in this area.

Hi Marina,

Looks like you have a full schedule still!

I’m still interested in having a chat about my future potential in your sphere. If you are still keen to. I don’t want to take up too much of your time!

Best,
Laurence

0.5 is just below what the inversion yields, but I suspect that it’s estimate of ~0.6 is too much.

 

Wasn’t S0912 down-shifted by 0.6?

 

In any case, the Stavely must have some interesting underground mountains.

In cases that I sought the shift down been no more than 0.5. It is very suspicious number.

 

We can do modelling later when having more time. 

I know that Theodora was playing a lot with 2D/3D wavefront modelling, for fun.

 

I need to ask her what she is done.

Subject:	Local approximation for SMC [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

Hi Marina and Alexei,

 

Here is a paper that would be a good reference implementation for local approximation for inversions in the codebase Ross and I have developed:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1694.pdf

 

It would require some refactoring of the parallelisation of forward model processing to separate the returned products from the model proposals via some sort of approximation conduit class. This approximation class can then be used to produce the approximate forward models and likelihood weights, and it should also inform the inversion engine where forward models should be computed given a cloud of proposed particles at each kernel iteration.

 

The upshot of this is that much more intelligent proposals can be used e.g. dual-averaging NUTS.

 

I strongly recommend that this becomes a priority in the next few months such that the H/V deliverable is met in a timely manner. Without this smoothing, the compute time on RJSMC for each H/V observation could be quite large given the minimum cloud size should be proportionally greater than approximately k*n^2 where n = number of parameters.

 

Please feel free to ask questions, I would also be happy to run a short mathematical seminar on the proposed direction of Transdimensional H/V processing for internal GA staff.

 

Thank you and regards,

Subject: S0400 2 mode inversion [SEC=UNCLASSIFIED]

 

Alexei,

 

An inversion with 2 Rayleigh modes and Love wave approximation using scaled vertical motion yields a ground profile that more closely matches drilling. The higher frequency data is not well fitted but this may be due to how well it actually represents the model given that atmospheric and anthropomorphic noise are not included in the model.

 

Two things I need to discuss with you:

1)      The philosophy/maths behind how the error bars are computed. I have made changes but these may or may not be considered “advances”.

2)      How Love wave bias is approximated.

?Hi Marina,

 

No reminder appointment has been sent to the division about RD morining tea which means that the originally schedulled date has slipped the attention of both Jade and myself. This may have happened due to some other rescheduled items such as the new format team brief and that the last morning tea was postponed by a week on request from OSE.

 

Since the rest of RD won't be aware of the morning tea, would you be ok to reschedule? I'm not sure how much you've prepped the section already, so if you are keen to go ahead today we can try to make do.

 

Apologies for the confusion!

Hi Chris,

 

Just to follow up, I have a short write up in progress on SMC inversion using multiple move types and have slightly extended your choice of R to include multiple moves using a multinomial distribution. I haven’t seen this in your subsequent literature so thought it would be worth adding (please correct me if I’m mistaken). Would you be interested in reviewing that section?

 

Kind regards,

Hi Chris,

 

Apologies for the delay, I've been in and out of airports yesterday.

 

You're right, 20 params for a 5 layer model. I set the maximum at a generous 15 layers.

 

Attached is an animation of SMC using an RJMCMC kernel on data taken from a site with known granite basement at 50m. Basement is roughly characterised by a Vs (shear velocity) contrast that crosses 1000m/s.

 

I had to stratify the ESS and resampling steps to avoid over-fitting. I'm not sure if this is the best or even correct way, but it seems to get results. 

 

The biggest problem is SMC "finishes" the 1,000,000 temperature steps too soon (first 16 frames) and the remainder is straight RJMCMC. I am not sure what to do about this- do you have any recommendations e.g. temperature annealing?

 

Cheers,

Laurence?

Hi Laurence

 

Just to understand a bit better, in say a 5 layer model is there 5 X (3+1) = 20 parameters?

 

What might be the typical maximum number of layers?

 

This sounds like a cool application.  Would be interested to see more details at some point when you have written it up.  In the future there might be a different way to do it, do SMC for 1 layer model, then use that as starting point for 2 layer model, etc etc.  Avoid reversible jump that way.

Hi Chris,

 

That makes sense. In my problem the parameters are updated component-wise in layers (like blocks) but with different move types. In each layer, there are three "value" parameters and one position parameter for the layer partition position. There can be N layers, where N is not determined, hence the reversible-jump aspect. An MCMC move is first selected with 1/4 probability:

 

1) Layer "value" parameter change. One value param is chosen at random in this move.

2) Layer partition position parameter change.

3) Birth of a new layer

4) Death of a layer

 

The birth/death moves generally have a much lower acceptance rate. Say if the value change move has an acceptance rate of 30%, the birth/death moves would be 3-5% each.

 

Since the MCMC move type is selected with a fixed probability 1/4 right now, I can change that to reflect the chosen R value for each move type. 

 

Is the summing of the Ri values to constitute one "total" move somewhat philosophical? I would say that in the SMC move step, I guess it would be preferable if each of the RJMCMC move types have the specified 0.99 probability of occuring at least once, instead of just one of the move types, but I don't know why this would be preferable. Is this inferred in your paper? I'd like to reference it if so. I'm giving a talk this week and your work and lectures have been the most influential on me taking this path.

Laurence

Hi Laurence

 

Are the different moves designed to move only specific parameters?  I.e. are the parameters being updated in blocks in some way?  If so it is perfectly reasonably to do R1, R2, ... , RK iterations in total where Ri is the number of iterations for the ith move and K is the total number of possible moves.  So yes this would be R1+R2+...+RK MCMC iterations in total.

 

If you have several types of moves that perturb all parameters, then it is less clear what to do I think.  We could consider an “iteration” where we choose one of the type of proposals at random.  Then do that “iteration” on each particle once, and work out an R value from that.  You could weight the proposals similar to what you say below if you find that some proposal is better than another.  The R value that you calculate needs to give you a high probability of moving a particular particle at least once for good diversity.

 

Does that make sense?

?Hi Chris,

 

Thank you for your clear reply and advice. Breaking it down into specifics, should I specify a move-specific R value for each move type u, say R_u and then in the move step choose a move v based on probability P(choose move v) = R_v / sum(R_u over all u) ? 

 

So far I've been getting results that look like they will converge but fall short once I've cycled through one complete pass of the temperature array. Thinking that I was setting R too low, and based on intuition,, should I set the number of MCMC steps to R=sum(R_u over all u)??

Alexei,

 

An inversion with 2 Rayleigh modes and Love wave approximation using scaled vertical motion yields a ground profile that more closely matches drilling. The higher frequency data is not well fitted but this may be due to how well it actually represents the model given that atmospheric and anthropomorphic noise are not included in the model.

 

Two things I need to discuss with you:

1)      The philosophy/maths behind how the error bars are computed. I have made changes but these may or may not be considered “advances”.

2)      How Love wave bias is approximated.

No reminder appointment has been sent to the division about RD morining tea which means that the originally schedulled date has slipped the attention of both Jade and myself.

Hi Matt,





Thank you for the comprehensive treatment of the modelling options!





Just two observations at this stage:





SMC vs MCMC:


?Doucet (2010) gives a nice intro to SMC in terms of on-line filtering, but it is equally applicable offline.


http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/doucet_defreitas_gordon_smcbookintro.pdf




I would be more than happy to give a brief intro over coffee :)




PyMC3, NA, etc

?These are all robust valid approaches. I'm leaning towards trying both just to see how well each performs. I am leaning towards PyMC3 because it implements SMC^2 and some of the HMC-based kernels. NUTS is a particularly cool sampler to watch. For your amusement, check this out if you haven't seen it: http://chifeng.scripts.mit.edu/stuff/mcmc-demo/





The subsampling and covariance information is most welcome! I'm keen to explore how well it can be applied. Over the next two weeks I'll put together a phased recommendation and a pilot for the NK event data using the most basic topo-adapted Mogi. It is easy to be side-tracked by samplers so I'll leave the tuning details of that for a later phase.





Looking forward to it!

Hi Laurence,

 

I was thinking more about your modelling task last night and it occurred to me that there are some other things you will need to consider…

 

Data transformation

 

You will probably need to convert the geodetic reference frame of the geocoded InSAR data to a local grid (UTM) frame for use with a Mogi model, which (I think) assumes a Cartesian space. I have some simple matlab functions that do this if you need, but I’m sure it is possible in python, for instance using ‘pyproj’

 

Data subsampling

 

You talked about the need for a forward model that can be evaluated quickly/cheaply. Interferograms are very large sets of observations and the vast majority of those observations are redundant due to the spatial correlation of the deformation signals of interest. A common practice is to use a quadtree algorithm to perform a subsampling of the interferogram with a variable resolution dependant on the variance of the data within the grid cell. These two papers were the first to use this approach in InSAR:

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2ad/9eb614919faf471027fcf13d7dd9332f64cb.pdf http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/famelung/FalkWebsite/FalkWebsite_domain.sites2/JonssonZebkerSegallAmelung_BSSA_2002.pdf <http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/personal/famelung/FalkWebsite/FalkWebsite_domain.sites2/JonssonZebkerSegallAmelung_BSSA_2002.pdf> 

 

This Caltech python package could save you a lot of time in this respect (computational effort and coding effort). It also claims to estimate the spatial covariance of the data ;-) http://earthdef.caltech.edu/projects/varres/wiki 

 

Data Covariance

 

A simple way to account for the data’s spatial covariance is to perform an autocorrelation on the interferogram observations then fit an exponential function to the resulting covariance observations as a function of increasing distance between observations. PyRate has a module that implements this that you could make use of. See pyrate.covariance.cvd https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PyRate/blob/master/pyrate/covariance.py <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PyRate/blob/master/pyrate/covariance.py>  I previously put together a notebook on this (attached) with respect to the PyRate algorithm

 

MCMC vs SMC

 

Did some reading last night, but I can’t understand what the difference between Markov Chain MC and Sequential MC is. Are you able to explain over a coffee? Some links that I found interesting regarding Bayesian methods and application in InSAR and deformation modelling:

 

https://inv-conj-geophy.sciencesconf.org/conference/inv-conj-geophy/probabilistic_source_inversion.pdf 

http://earth.esa.int/fringe09/proceedings/papers/s4_10hoop.pdf 

 

Neightbourhood algorithm

 

Also attached are Ben’s grad rotation report and presentation slides that summarise the work he did using the NA with synthetic data for the poroelastic model. His synthetic data was generated with Gaussian noise, not spatially correlated noise like we might expect in InSAR (due to atmospheric delays)

 

Existing Python packages

 

Looks like PyMC3 is the leading MCMC python package in terms of robustness, contributions and currency. http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html It has several sampling algorithms to choose from. This could be a good black box solution to use in the back end of your tool – it could free up your time to develop other features.

Matt

Given some tweaking of the priors, I'm fairly confident you can invert all of the useful data within your KSU quota. Perhaps we could refine a heuristic for selecting processing sites based on your suggested peak H/V to RMS ratio threshold.

I'd like to chat with you about the direction and content of the passive seismic workshop. Would you have a spare moment tomorrow?





I am concerned about the level of input from Alexei on the trans D output, and that the shifting priorities have sidelined my work in the trans D code. I'm sure you understand that I need to balance the priorities ahead for my career and it looks like my involvement in passive seismic would regrettably all but disappear due to these shifting priorities.

   Feel free to come any time. I am usually around. We plan to introduce Geopsy use as a base of training. Would be good if you can get on board and help with coaching.

I don’t think there is any need for trans-D due to the very old laptops that wouldn’t run it anyway. Would be great if you could prepare one or two slides talking about our intention to play in this field.

Can you get good fit to test data as you used to have for other sites? The last image/movie you showed does not fit high frequency spectrum well.

Hi Alexei and Marina,

 

I’m keen to get on top of what is needed for the dry run this weekend, and think that the meeting next week is too close to the run itself. Can we meet this week? It would give me enough time to sort out any issues, especially with the trans D code usage – absolutely nobody else has used it yet and I think it’s too much to ask to have a room of grads test it when I’m the only one who has been doing user testing so far.

Thanks for the update. I’ve put the files into the directory: /g/data1/dg9/INSAR_ANALYSIS/NORTH_KOREA/PALSAR2/GAMMA/modelling

 

I’ll test running the code and then go through it with Laurence. I’ve put the code in the above directory for now but it hasn’t been compiled.

Hi Sarah,

 

Laurence and I just discussed the scope of his task to develop an InSAR modelling capability. North Korea will be the case study, using a Mogi model to (hopefully) determine size, depth and epicentre of the nuclear test.

 

Over the next two weeks he is going to evaluate:

 

1)      The most appropriate tool for the task, either using existing software/code (e.g. NA or python monte carlo libraries) or to be written

2)      An estimate of the time needed to complete the task.

 

To help him with regard point 1, please demonstrate to Laurence the NA code you received from ANU, that was used for the Peterman Ranges project.

 

He also needs the unwrapped geocoded ALOS-2 interferograms for North Korea together with geocoded coherence, DEM and looking vector products. I’ll help Laurence read those with Python in the next couple of days. Can you gather them together in a directory at NCI please?

 

Cheers,

Matt

The peak fit is not so good. The inversion spends a lot of effort fitting the high freqs which aren’t as important I think. Also, non-uniqueness will always be your enemy here and makes most results unpublishable. I’m afraid I can’t fix that aspect for you.

 

I’m also concerned about the data offset, and need to discuss this with you. Basically modelling Love waves as a vertical shift means that Love wave spectrum imitates the amplitudes of the vertical spectrum. Does this sound physically reasonable to you?

The old laptops would definitely not run it without local approximation smoothing. Something I’ve intended to code up but that would take a couple of weeks of solid work. Maybe something I can do when I return to your section? J

 

Regarding the “fit”, how sure are you that the high frequencies are not anthropogenic or atmospheric? I switched the inversion to use uncorrelated error and you do indeed get a better “looking” fit, but try to think about how well it maps the drill data ;)

HI Laurence

 

   Feel free to come any time. I am usually around. We plan to introduce Geopsy use as a base of training. Would be good if you can get on board and help with coaching.

I don’t think there is any need for trans-D due to the very old laptops that wouldn’t run it anyway. Would be great if you could prepare one or two slides talking about our intention to play in this field.

Can you get good fit to test data as you used to have for other sites? The last image/movie you showed does not fit high frequency spectrum well.

Cheers,

Hi Alexei and Marina,

 

I’m keen to get on top of what is needed for the dry run this weekend, and think that the meeting next week is too close to the run itself. Can we meet this week? It would give me enough time to sort out any issues, especially with the trans D code usage – absolutely nobody else has used it yet and I think it’s too much to ask to have a room of grads test it when I’m the only one who has been doing user testing so far.

It’ll still be my job for a long while I’d say.

 

Book something in my calendar for next week, say Tuesday morning at 11, and we can actually run an inversion together on your data. I promise it’ll take less time than you think, and we’ll be able to plot intermediate products.

Dear Matt and Laurence,

 

Yesterday I received some good news from Karol, Laurence is one of the people who have been selected to attend the workshops in Perth.

Laurence, could you please talk with Matt about your commitments and get permission to assist with the inversion workshop dry run (3 hours next week) and to visit Perth.

Laurence I don’t have the full details about the Perth Trip (number of days), when I get those I will send them to you.

thanks

Hi Alexei and Marina,

 

I’m keen to get on top of what is needed for the dry run this weekend, and think that the meeting next week is too close to the run itself. Can we meet this week? It would give me enough time to sort out any issues, especially with the trans D code usage – absolutely nobody else has used it yet and I think it’s too much to ask to have a room of grads test it when I’m the only one who has been doing user testing so far.

Laurence,

 

Re the email below, I have discussed Jason’s problem with David Lescinsky and it seems that all we should have to do is to give Jason membership of a group which has access to raijin and the copyq. Given the tasks that Jason is working on, we thought that this ought to be vy72. I’ll ask for him to be given access shortly, but just want you to be aware of that so that the request does not come out of the blue.

Hello Grant,

 

We try to move some ANU passive seismic data on NCI’s massdata storage to ha3.

The source of the data is on massdata storage: group u36, owner/user: axa157

NCI suggests that we do this through you (see below).

It would be great if you could let us know the right way to proceed.

Hi Jason,

I am closing this ticket for now.

FYI, the only thing you need in order to get access to mdss archive from Rajin is the home folder which can only be created for members of projects that have compute resources. To get compute resources for copyq jobs that allow you to transfer a large amount of data, please get in touch with Grant Butler, the scheme manager of GA.

Cheers

Hi Jason,

 

To log into Raijin, request access to vy72. In the Projects sidebar link click “Find a project” and then enter vy72 into the search box. Then in the project info for vy72 there is a tab on which you can click a “request access” button. I can then add you once you’ve requested access. Then you’ll be able to log into Raijin user nodes.

Hi Laurence,

All python versions on Raijin come with only four  extra modules, ipython, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. Can you install the python packages in your own directory? According to your description of the current problem, it sounds to me that you need to install at least jpy and wheel modules under your own directory. Have a look at our opus page https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Python about how to install your own python modules.

Hi NCI Helpdesk,

 

I’m trying to get an instance of esa-snappy python bindings up and running. The roadblock is the setup script is cannot find a *.whl file for jpy that matches 

 

jpy_wheel_file_pat = 'jpy-{version}-%s-{abi_tag}-%s.whl' % (python_tag, platform_tag)

 

There is a jpy module available on Raijin but as far as I can tell the wheel module is not available. Is it possible to install the wheel module for the standard python3/3.6.2 module? My last resort would be to create an entirely new python stack for esa-snappy, but this is unfavourable.

 

Kind regards,

Hi Marina,

 

It is an honour to be selected, thank you!

 

I will follow up with Matt today or tomorrow when he has a moment.

 

In the meantime, I’ve been trying to invert the S0400 site data with varying success. Alexei gave me an unfamiliar H/V data file from HVTFA in Geopsy with a weighting scheme that I haven’t adapted to the RJSMC code. So I’ve been pre-processing the H/V data in an attempt to replicate his data shape and allow RJSMC to invert for it.  It would be good to meet with both you and Alexei to get an idea of the expected output for this site for the workshop. Would this be convenient for you before the dry run next week at all?

Good chat as always.

 

I just did a spot of joogling and wonder if you’ve read these: 

 

A thesis on analytical models: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a225570.pdf Go to the figure(9) on page 90 which looks like it shows the rectification effect you’re observing.

A two-inlet analytical model (probably over the top) https://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/estuaries/publications/aretxabaleta_et_al_linear.pdf

 

This one is also interesting and uses new buzzy techniques but I didn’t see much on the model assumptions: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1755876X.2015.1014641?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Journal_of_Operational_Oceanography_TrendMD_0

 

All of that considered, maybe you’re right about pre-filtering. If you just want predictive components of higher frequencies for non-seasonal variation, maybe high-pass filter to a period of two-three days and then run your least squares fit?

 

Also, something we didn’t get to chat over coffee but if you have time later I’d like to discuss a non-work-related thing with you. Maybe over an after-work beer this week?

No worries about going straight to work, I enjoy looking at new ideas. Signal processing is fun.

 

I’m up for a bev this evening if that’s still an option.

Hey bud,

 

Very stimulating chat. I will give the references a bit of a read. The Aretxableta (what a name) paper looks to be particularly relevant. In the meantime changing all negative values to the mean appears to set up a reasonably promising impulse response type question.

 

Apologies for putting you straight to work for this morning’s coffee. Let’s have a chat outside of work hours as you said perhaps with beer in hand. TBH some time this evening is looking like the best option for this but let me know otherwise.

 

Cheers
